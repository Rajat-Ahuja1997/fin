In the context of an auction system, events represent significant occurrences in the system. Here are a few examples of potential events that the system could emit and handle:

3. **User Outbid:** This event could be emitted by the Bid Service when a higher bid is placed on an item, superseding a previous highest bid by a user. This event's payload might include the item ID, the outbid user's ID, and the new highest bid amount.

4. **Auction Ended:** This event could be emitted by the Item Service when the auction end time for an item has been reached. The payload of this event could contain the item ID and the winning bid details.


Each of these events could trigger various actions in different microservices. For example, when the 'New Bid Placed' event is published, the Notification Service could listen for this event and send a notification to the relevant users. Similarly, when the 'Auction Ended' event is published, the Bid Service could listen for this event and finalize the winning bid.
